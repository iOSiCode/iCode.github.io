								<header class="major">

								<p>
									iCode will be run and managed by the two owners:
								</p>
								<p>
									Amal Al Hattali - <b>Manager</b><br />
									&emsp;&emsp;Amal is a commercial law student at MCBS. Amal has a business experience as comes from a family of four different businesses and she 
									got herself involved in many aspects of the businesses to help develop and grow the businesses further, she even generated some crucial ideas and 
									managed their instagram accounts. 
									<br />&emsp;&emsp;Amal will have many roles to help iCode stay organized at all times:
									<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - Managing the overall operation of iCode.
									<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - Taking care of the registration and payment process.
									<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - Customer support.
								</p>
								<p>
									Omar Al Raisi - <b>Instructor</b><br />
									&emsp;&emsp;Omar is a Computer Science student at MCBS who is passionate about programming, and more importantly about technology. Before 
									joining MCBS, Omar became a teacher's assistance for a programming course at SQU, where he was responsible of explaining the practical aspect 
									of programming to students.<br />
									&emsp;&emsp;Omar's sole role in iCode is to teach the course and make sure of providing a high quality course of iOS development.
								</p>

								<br /><br /><br />

								<!--Our Prices-->
								<header class="major">
									<span class="date">Our Prices</span>
								</header>

								<p>
									After a long reasearch, we gathered some information about the prices of courses that are similar to the one we offer. We have broken the courses
									into two categories
								</p>

								<p>&emsp;&emsp; - Pre-recorded courses:</p>
								<p class="alignImage">
									<img src="images/prices01.png">
								</p>

								<p><br />&emsp;&emsp; - Live online courses:</p>
								<p class="alignImage">
									<img src="images/prices02.png">
								</p>

								<p>
									We fall under the later category. However, we bring a unique price point that will be around 2 to 3 OMR per hour which is around 100 to 150 OMR 
									for the full course. The reason we offer a low price for such a greate value, is to motivate the youth of Oman and to create a competitave 
									technological industry in the coming years.
								</p>

								<br /><br /><br />

								<!--What we need from MCBS-->
								<header class="major">
									<span class="date">What We Require</span>
								</header>
								
								<p>
									We are confident that we are more than ready to proceed with the course. However, we require the aid of the Modern College of Business and Science 
									in two ways: <br />
									&emsp;&emsp; - To help us market the course.<br />
									&emsp;&emsp; - If possible to provide certificates.
